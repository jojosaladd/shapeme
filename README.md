# ShapeMe: Custom 3D Avatars from Your Body Measurements, with OBJ Export

ShapeMe is a desktop application (distributed as an .exe) that lets you generate a custom 3D avatar based on one or more body measurements. The app reshapes a parametric body model in real time and allows you to export the result directly as an .obj file for use in 3D software, visualization, or apparel design workflows.

This project was adapted from [3D Human Body Reshaping with Anthropometric Modeling](https://github.com/zengyh1900/3D-Human-Body-Shape?tab=readme-ov-file) by Yanhong Zeng, Jianlong Fu, Hongyang Chao. The approach for estimating body measurements was based on their work, and portions of their open-sourced codebase were used. Training data come from [SPRING](https://graphics.soe.ucsc.edu/data/BodyModels/index.html), with 1,500 female meshes used for training.
